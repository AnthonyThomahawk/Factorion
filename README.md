# Factorion
Simple C++ program to find factorions

# Compile & Usage
Tested compilers are g++ and MSVC (of visual studio 2019), possibly all other C++ compilers will work too.

After you run the program you will get an option to search factorions up to a limit, or check if a single number is a factorion
